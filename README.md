It's my first attempt at building a simple python application that uses simpleRAG to answer questions to a pdf that is locally saved.
Initially I used nltk library for tokenization. Later on I tried a few things using spaCy to see if there are any differences.
Later on I built a custom tokenizer class that my application can use.
